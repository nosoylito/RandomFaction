- there are 2 permanent factions.
- players can only kill opposite faction players.
- players can only team with same faction players.
- you only join a faction killing or getting killed.
- you cant change your faction for the whole wipe.
- when a player is first killed  by another player, automatically joins the opposite faction.
- if none of both players have a faction, each join a different faction.
- When you shoot/attack a player from your own faction, hitmarker sound and visual is different to indicate hes from your factio  ans cant kill him.
- you cant damage bases of players from your own faction.
- members of a faction can vote to kick somebody from the faction. If voting is TRUE, player will be removed from the faction, and will not be ablo to join ANY faction. He will be alone and killed by everyone for the remaining of the wipe. (maybe he scammed someone from his faction or is griefing in any socially unacceptable way). Giving a sense of actual belonging to a tribe and the fear of being left alone.
